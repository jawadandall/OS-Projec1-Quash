# Shell Implementation Project Report

## Project Overview
This project implements a custom shell (command-line interface) in C, demonstrating fundamental operating system and system programming concepts such as process management, signal handling, and command parsing.

## System Architecture

### Modular Design
The shell is implemented using a modular approach, separating different functionalities into distinct source files:

1. **shell2.c**: Main shell program and entry point
2. **commandParser.c**: Command parsing and routing
3. **builtInFunctions.c**: Built-in shell commands implementation
4. **processManagement.c**: Process creation and management
5. **signalHandlers.c**: Signal handling mechanisms

### Design Principles
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each module handles a specific aspect of shell functionality
- **Modularity**: Functions are organized into logical components
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error checking and reporting
- **Extensibility**: Modular design allows easy addition of new features

## Key Components and Functionality

### 1. Command Parsing (`commandParser.c`)
- Tokenizes input command line
- Routes commands to appropriate execution functions
- Supports built-in commands and external command execution

### 2. Built-in Functions (`builtInFunctions.c`)
Implemented built-in commands include:
- `pwd`: Print current working directory
- `cd`: Change directory
- `echo`: Print arguments
- `exit`: Terminate shell
- `env`: Display environment variables
- `setenv`: Set environment variable

### 3. Process Management (`processManagement.c`)
- Handles process creation using `fork()`
- Supports background and foreground process execution
- Manages process cleanup
- Implements background process detection with `&` operator

### 4. Signal Handling (`signalHandlers.c`)
- Manages signals like `SIGINT` (Ctrl+C)
- Implements timeout mechanism for long-running processes
- Provides process group management

### 5. Main Shell Loop (`shell2.c`)
- Continuous command input and execution
- Displays current working directory as prompt
- Handles input parsing and command routing

## Technical Implementation Details

### Process Creation Strategy
- Uses `fork()` to create child processes
- Child processes execute commands via `execvp()`
- Parent process manages process state and waits for completion

### Signal Handling Approach
- Uses `sigaction()` for robust signal management
- Differentiates between foreground and background process signal treatment
- Prevents shell interruption during critical operations

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error checking for system calls
- Informative error messages
- Graceful error recovery where possible

## Noteworthy Implementation Techniques

1. **Dynamic Argument Parsing**
   - Supports variable number of arguments
   - Handles command-line input flexibly

2. **Environment Variable Management**
   - Uses external `environ` pointer for environment access
   - Provides `setenv` functionality

3. **Background Process Support**
   - Detects background processes via `&` operator
   - Provides non-blocking execution

## Potential Improvements
- Add more built-in commands
- Implement input/output redirection
- Support piping between commands
- Enhanced tab completion
- More sophisticated signal handling

## Compilation and Execution
Compile with:
```bash
gcc -o shell shell2.c commandParser.c builtInFunctions.c processManagement.c signalHandlers.c
```

## Conclusion
This shell implementation demonstrates core operating system programming concepts, showcasing process management, signal handling, and command parsing techniques in C.
